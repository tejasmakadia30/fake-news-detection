# Fake News Detection: Project Overview
--> Made a fake news detection project to distinguish between which news is fake and which is true.                                                                       
--> Dataset for this project is from Kaggle.                                                                                                                                   
--> Engineered feature from text and title and compare with the character and words of fake and real news to relate.                                                            
--> Optimized Linear Regression and Decision Tree to reach the best model.
